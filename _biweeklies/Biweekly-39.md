## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* New H2020 project involving digital twins (called PROBONO) has just been granted with Carl Schultz as the ECE/AU PI

#### Nick Battle
* Created a "new_model" branch for VDMCheck and converted "fmi2" checker to use generated XSD/VDM schema. Currently testing.
* Looked at some native VDM/Java models for Ken Pierce (student support work)
* Cleaned up VDMJ for nested comment LB decisions, and ported change over to Overture.
* Prepared VDMJ for the next VSCode release, to include Hugo's stdlib changes.

#### Daniella Tola
* Found a nice Python library for visualizing robots (a number of robot arm models exist, but other models can possibly be added using URDf files), packaged it into an FMU and tested it in into-cps. It works on windows, and on Mac Mojave, but not on Mac Catalina (Got help fom Gita to test it on Mac). But this could be a direction to work towards in the future, if we want to do visualizations for co-simulations using python FMUs.
