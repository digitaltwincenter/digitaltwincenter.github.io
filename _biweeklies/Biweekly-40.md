    * A Universal Mechanism for Implementing Functional Mock-up Units accepted at SIMULTECH
    * Towards a Digital Twin Framework for Autonomous Robots accepted at COMPSAC 
  * In Preparation:
    * A Digital Twin of Extraneous Water in preparation 
    * Modelling an Injection Molding Machine using the Vienna Development Method to OVT19 
  * Planned
    * ?Digital Twins? (invited paper as a follow up of the evanet.dk presentation)  
    * vs-code extensions to OVT19


#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Discussion with Springer about the suggested book on engineering digital twins has started
* Isola volume with our digital twin track should soon become available

#### Jim Woodcock
* I completed the preparation and recording of my lectures on probabilistic robotic control.
* I've returned to thinking about a calculus of uncertainty for robotics (and CPS more generally).

#### Nick Battle
* Converted both FMI2 and FMI3 checkers to use the generated XSD-to-VDM schema.
* Updating dynamic model and tests for FMI3 to catch up with changes to the schema/semantics.
* Still need to verify checkers against stock FMUs, but a few trials looks OK.
* Fixes to VDMJ and LSP along the way as small issues have occured while using VSCode to develop.
