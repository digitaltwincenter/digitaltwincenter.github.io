## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* New possible DT proposal for ESA discussed with Airbus
* DT proposal for grand solution applicayion to IFD has been called for interview in September
* New DT opportunity in connection with Vitual Vehicle

#### Nick Battle
* Meet with Claudio, Daniella and Christian about Clocks and progress the Clocks static model for FMI3.
* Discuss port of Overture CSV library to VDMJ with Hugo
* Raise various static semantic queries (via Claudio) regarding Clock configuration rules.
* Some updates to the LSP HLD.
* Investigating smoother VDMCheck integration with Maestro.

#### Frederik Madsen
* Implemented console logging runtime module for MaBL.
* Refactored Scenario Verifier as an expansion plugin - still needs CLI support.
* Refactored external tests for Maestro2.
* Started planning presentation for FM Tutorial with Simon.

#### Hugo Daniel Macedo
* vdm-vscode Working on CSV support in VDMJ
* Planning MUDP/VUDP Extraneous Water project continuation
* Finished first version of the Injection Modling Machine VDM model with Till. Continuous time model with Till and Michael also running now.

#### Casper Thule
* Maestro2 cpp gen + DSE support
* RABBITMQ paper progression
* Network setup with incubator
* ESA-GSTP comments
* Digital Twin Platform meeting with Cladio and Kenneth to join forces -> shared vision.
* Initiating FMI3 support in Maestro2 and native libraries.
* Desktop Robotti Progress (New motor, new drilling, localisation)
* Fault Injection case studies

#### Mirgita Frasheri
* wrapping up the rbmq paper, we have all the results now, but there are some missing sections to be written.
* progress on the time discrepancy paper, we're (with Casper, Henrik, and Lukas) converging towards the solution with oosmc as an fmu.
* updated the desktop robotti fault injection scenarios with Casper. 
* work on the collision zones, implemented a very simple function that calculates the velcoity obstacle (from the lit), i.e. velocities for which there will be collisions. 
* Desktop Robotti guys: Jacob has ordered a servo-to-shaft coupler for the steering motors, that can be used to hook up the motors of the old desktop robotti into the new one, and test compatibility, before ordering the new motors. Waiting for this to arrive. 
* some little work with the scenario space exploration, still not much progress though.

#### Claudio Gomes
* fmi3 overview, fmi3 clocks, and Giuseppe's master algorithm papaers accepted at modelica conference
* coding fmi3 synchronous clocks co-simulation scenario (as a reference implementation)
* DT book sample chapter drafted (from Hao's paper)
* Met with Nick, Daniella, and Christian, over potential synchronous clocks research.
* Emailed with Nick over several ambiguities in the fmi standard.
