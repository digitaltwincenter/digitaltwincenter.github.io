## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Stakeholder 1
* Discussion Point 1
* Discussion Point 2

#### Jim Woodcock
* We now have a working prototype generating verified animations from within Isabelle using the Iteraction Tree work (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05133). I'm now including this in the Isabelle course I'm developing. I also intend to use it to code up an animation for angelic nondeterminism for an abstract specification of roll back and adaptive steps in FMI master algorithms.

#### Nick Battle
* Assist Leo with his VDMJ plugin implementation of an Isabelle translation of VDM-SL.
* Attend Overture-19 :-)
* Talk to Claudio and Simon about the detail of the formal model of clocks in FMI3.
