## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Got a new DIREC project called Embedded AI granted (one new PhD student for 2022) (Jalil to be mail supervisor)
* Close to get new PhD student from the Thomas B Thriges Font (Alexandros to be main supervisor)
* Restarting the AgroRobottiFleet project

#### Jim Woodcock
* I prepared and gave a lecture on Uncertainty and Probability in UTP on Thursday 14th October at NWPU in China (Zhiming Liu's new university). This is a greatly abbreviated version of my tech report with a simple robotics-oriented example. Much easier to understand than the full report. :-)
* I'm working on examples for the Isabelle course.
* I'm going to submit a joint proposal to the UK EPSRC later today on photo-realistic 3D traffic simulations (my part is in verifying scenarios automatically generated from CCTV footage, including emergent behaviours). 

#### Nick Battle
* Added code lens support to the LSP protocol, and implemented "Launch" and "Debug" lenses to allow func/ops to be run directly.
* Complete support for the RemoteControl interface in VSCode - allows native front ends to a VDM model.
* Help Leo Freitas with some RemoteControl problems.
* Won't be able to attend the meeting on 15th - on holiday :)

#### Frederik Madsen
* Working on JNI Fmi3 interface.
* Working on DTP in into-cps application.

#### Hugo Daniel Macedo
* Working on implementation of client side for code lenses and configurations for the VSCode Extension.
* Prepared release with Gill for the INTO-CPS App release candidate including Fredrics' added Scenario Verif.
  * https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/into-cps-application/releases/tag/v4.0.4-rc
* Preparing the last details of OVT-19.
* Working with Christian Lillelund on a paper on DT for water based on DTU's open dataset from Belinde region mentioned in one of the Live from Behind the Walls...
* Prepraring a EUROSTARS project in the water domain.   

#### Mirgita Frasheri
* Working on the agent papers, there are some issues in the Gama simulation, currently debugging.
* Desktop robotti - we are close to replicating the emergency stop and parallel operation with the new desktop robottis
* Rabbitmq fmu - there is an issue with the generated dll, so the fmu cannot run on windows, we are currently with Casper and Henrik tyring to get to the bottom of this.
* Had some discussions on scenario generation with Daniella, we are now working on setting up a script that can automatically run a gazebo and unity simulation, and configure it -- something very basic at first. 

#### Emil Madsen
AURT:
- Adding support for online estimation
- Ordered robot arm payloads of sizes 0,5 kg to 7 kg to be used for online estimation

AU DTL-Skjern:
- Awaiting response from Technicon regarding non-functioning flex cell laser-scanner safety system

#### Casper Thule
- JNI to FMI3 fixes
- DTP initial UI into into-cps application
- RabbitMQ FMU windows compilation issues
- Overture Workshop
