## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Got a new DIREC project called Embedded AI granted (one new PhD student for 2022) (Jalil to be mail supervisor)
* Close to get new PhD student from the Thomas B Thriges Font (Alexandros to be main supervisor)
* Restarting the AgroRobottiFleet project

#### Jim Woodcock
* I prepared and gave a lecture on Uncertainty and Probability in UTP on Thursday 14th October at NWPU in China (Zhiming Liu's new university). This is a greatly abbreviated version of my tech report with a simple robotics-oriented example. Much easier to understand than the full report. :-)
* I'm working on examples for the Isabelle course.
* I'm going to submit a joint proposal to the UK EPSRC later today on photo-realistic 3D traffic simulations (my part is in verifying scenarios automatically generated from CCTV footage, including emergent behaviours). 

#### Nick Battle
* Added code lens support to the LSP protocol, and implemented "Launch" and "Debug" lenses to allow func/ops to be run directly.
* Complete support for the RemoteControl interface in VSCode - allows native front ends to a VDM model.
* Help Leo Freitas with some RemoteControl problems.
* Won't be able to attend the meeting on 15th - on holiday :)
