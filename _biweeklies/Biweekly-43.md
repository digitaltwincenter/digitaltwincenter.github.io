## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->


#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Since I will be the Danish cluster 4 support for the ministry I expect to spot more opportunities about digital twins earlier than normal

#### Nick Battle
* Created an error renumbering script for the FMI models (to avoid accidental duplication of error numbers)
* Added specialized @OnFail annotation handling for the Maestro FMI static checker (awaiting test in Maestro itself)
* Some more updates to the LSP HLD
* Added @VDMFunction and @VDMOperation Java annotations for VDMJ native libs, to protect against "operations" being used in functions.

* Will attend "Live from Behind the Walls" Team meeting.
