## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Attended a workshop on the Vico platform from NTNU last week
* Discussed collaboration possibilities with Universal Robots
* Further planning of the book on engineering digital twins carried out
* Had brainstorm with Jakob regarding the Ringkøbing-Skjern project
* Have selected 2 PhD students for the Ringkøbing-Skjern project
* A new ITEA application called 3STARS have been submitted

#### Nick Battle
* Released FMI-VDM-Model 1.0.2
* Released VDMJ 4.4.2, leading to VDM VSCode release 1.1.0
* Contributed to Jonas/Frederik's F-IDE paper about VDM VSCode
* Create tool for automatic generation of ordered module dependencies (to support Leo's large specifications, but as a general tool)
* Debate the pros and cons of nested comment parsing with the Language Board :)
* Added SPDX licensing comments to the whole of VDMJ (GPLv3 or later)
* Added an experimental feature to save/restore specification state rather than re-calculating it every time between trace tests. This significantly improves the performance of combinatorial testing with very large specifications.
* Fixed some more F12 navigation issues (for ext and errs clauses)
* Released the above as VDM VSCode 1.1.1

#### Jim Woodcock
* Making progress with Pedro Ribeiro, Simon, and Cláudio on an abstract characterisation of step revision in FMI. Pedro and I have a description using angelic nondeterminism. We will present this to Simon, Cláudio, and Jaco on Wednesday 24th Feb.
* Started developing my lecture material on an introduction to probabilistic reobotic control for the modelling course.
* Submitted a research proposal to EPSRC on verified co-simulation.

#### Daniella Tola
* Integrated the C# backend for unifmu together with Christian. We haven't pushed it to the master branch yet.
* Starting looking into visualization of robots in Unity. They have recently been working on making it easier to visualize and simulate robots in Unity (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub)
* Starting looking into the Unity FMU in into-cps, to understand how it works. 

#### Claudio Gomes
* Finished Tutorial on Kalman Filtering for DTs with Hao
* Almost done with paper on DT Engineering with Hao
* Almost done with paper on adaptive master algorithm with Emin (KU Leuven)
* Going to prepare paper on FMI Clocks with fmi steering committee.

#### Stakeholder 3
* Discussion Point 1
* Discussion Point 2
