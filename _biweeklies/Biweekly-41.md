## Sub-projects status

Would it make sense to create a gitlab group for the repositories related to Digital Twins developed at AU?
We have been discussing where to put the repository for the AU Robotics Tool (the dynamics calibration tool), and think it may make sense to create a group for DTs and put the repositry there.
For example, at SDU they have a gitlab group for all the repositories related to SDU robotics: https://gitlab.com/sdurobotics.
