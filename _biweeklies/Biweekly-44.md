## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->


#### Hugo Daniel Macedo
* Participated in WATEC meeting on future wastewater treatment with nice visit to Marselisborg WTP.
* Wrote a magazine article to EVANET on Digital Twins
* Submitted an extended abstract to UDM on Extraneous water detection
* Submitted a paper to OVT-19 on DM for Injection Moulding Machine

#### Nick Battle
* Some progress on the VDM model of FMI3 clocks, but slow
* Contacted by folk from Anaplan about using VDMJ's LSP as a backend for the neovim editor. Made some fixes and enhancements to support that.
* Updated VDMCheck3 to schema version 3.0-beta.2
* Assisting Leo Freitas to migrate to VDM VSCode
* Added structured outlines to VDM VSCode which allows much better integration/navigation around the tool.
* Some paper review work for Overture workshop 19
* Released VDM VSCode version 1.2.0, VDMJ 4.4.3 and VDMCheck 1.1.0
* Added Graphviz file creation to VDM VSCode to enable the creation of module/class dependency graphs.
* Started work on VDM-RT log file integration for VDM VSCode.
* In July we had successful review of the DIGITbrain project (including digital twins)
* In September will have reviews of HUBCAP and UPSIM

#### Jim Woodcock
* **Probabilistic Robotic Control course**. I revised the lectures I gave on Carl's course. I repeated the lectures at Zhiming Liuâ€™s summer school in China using Zoom.
* **Isabelle course**. I've started work on writing this course, working with Simon Foster. We wil teach the course in York in Spring 2022. I'm hoping that the introductory lectures on Isabelle without Tears will be useful in Aarhus.
* **Paper with Lukas Estarte**. Verification and Uncertainties in Self-integrating System. This paper was accepted for SISSY2021. I've spent time helping to revise the paper to cover the reviewers' comments.
* **Uncertainty**. I've been working on probabilistic program models for uncertainty using new semantics I've created based on Iverson brackets. I've got a draft technical report. I'm planning to implement the semantics in Isabelle/UTP with Randall. I've got lots of small examples, but I'm working on a bigger case study on using Bayesian and Kalman filters for dealing with uncertainty from sensors with Gaussian errors.

#### Frederik Madsen
* Released Maestro2 version 2.1.6
* Implemented changes related to Scenario-verifier version 0.2.2
* Implemented CLI support for the Scenario-verifier in Maestro2
* Reworked dt-tutorial tests to use the Maestro2 CLI instead of the web API.
* Working on fmi3 support in Maestro2
* Working on implementing support for the Scenario-verifier functionality in the into-cps application.

#### Stakeholder 4
